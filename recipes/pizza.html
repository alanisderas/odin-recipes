<h2>This Garlic Chicken Pizza is a delicious homemade meal!</h2>

<p>Butter garlic sauce, chicken, tomato, ricotta, and Parmesan are baked together for a delightfully light-tasting dish.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
    <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
    
        <p>Place chicken breast in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool slightly, then cut into strips.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter with garlic, onion, and basil. Pour into a chilled dish to cool, and refrigerate until set.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Roll out pizza dough, place onto a pizza pan or other baking sheet, and spread herb butter over surface using the back of a spoon. Arrange chicken on top, then dot with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato slices, cilantro, and Parmesan cheese.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is browned and the center is cooked through.</p>
    </li>
    
</ol>
